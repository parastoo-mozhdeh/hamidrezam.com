    "text": "My name is Hamidreza Mozhdeh, born on 27 Mehr 1366, since I was a curious child, I loved analysis and abstractions, I saw almost everything as a system and I had to know how it works. My exploration and curiosities have become the foundation of my skills and activities today. Imagining the components of a system that work beautifully together, meeting the needs and solving the problems and challenges of each system is one of the abilities that I have gained through these years of experience. I entered the field of web design and programming since 2004, and I got my first experience by designing a website for the Xowan band, and I am still working in this field and I am trying to become an influential person in this field by increasing the depth of my skills. Be the field Having a better experience of life for myself and others is one of my goals in this field.",
